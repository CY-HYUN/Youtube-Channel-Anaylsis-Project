- **K-POP**: Moderate efficiency (avg 4.2 views/subscriber) - global but diverse audience
- **Food**: High efficiency (avg 5.9 views/subscriber) - niche, dedicated viewers
- **Fashion**: Lower efficiency (avg 3.1 views/subscriber) - trend-dependent engagement

**ROI Analysis Framework:**
```
Subscriber ROI = (Average Views per Video × Average Revenue per View) ÷ Subscriber Acquisition Cost
Engagement Quality Score = (Views + Likes×5 + Comments×10) ÷ Subscribers
```

**Strategic Insights:**
- **Quality over Quantity**: Channels with 100K highly engaged subscribers often outperform 1M+ low-engagement channels
